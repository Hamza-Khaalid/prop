# 💌 Proposal Webpage

**Proposal Webpage** is a fun and interactive digital proposal site designed to make the moment extra special. When someone tries to reject the proposal by clicking "No," the button escapes and changes text to gently persuade them to say "Yes." Once they say "Yes," a form appears to collect their contact info, which is sent directly to your email via Formspree.
